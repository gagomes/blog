I've been using Wordpress for a while and during this time, I couldn't help but feeling a constant tight-knot in my stomach due to the general lack of security in PHP and Wordpress. No matter how much I did to try and address the majority of the issues and the attack vectors I could imagine, it never felt like I did enough or that I would be spared in the next security bug.

After some inactivity, I have decided to migrate my blog to a statically generated one based on Jekyll (ugh, ruby,ugh!) 

The next few days will most certainly be spent mourning the loss of wordpress' nifty content publishing interface as I convert previous posts to markdown. Maybe.
